# Power-Bi-Project---Weather_Data_Analysis

# Weather Data Analysis (January 1948)

## Overview

This Power BI project visualizes and analyzes historical weather data from January 1948 to December 2017. It includes various visualizations to display temperature (TMAX, TMIN), precipitation (PRCP), and rain data over time.

## Visualizations

1. Pie Charts:
   - Count of RAIN and Sum of Month Column by RAIN
   - Count of Year Count by Month Column

2. Summary Metrics:
   - Count of TMIN: 14.08K
   - Count of TMAX: 83

3. Scatter Plot:
   - Max of TMAX and Min of TMIN by Year Count

4. Bar Charts:
   - Sum of PRCP and Sum of TMAX by Year Count
   - Sum of PRCP by Year

5. Line and Area Chart:
   - Sum of TMAX, Sum of TMIN, and Sum of TMAX by TMIN

6. Table:
   - Summary Table: TMAX, monthly counts, and sum of PRCP
